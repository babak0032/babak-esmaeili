I am a postdoc at [Generative AI group at the Eindhoven University of Technology (TU/e)](https://generativeai-tue.github.io/), advised by [Jakub M. Tomczak](https://jmtomczak.github.io/). I did my PhD at [AMLab](https://amlab.science.uva.nl/) at the University of Amsterdam where I was advised by [Jan-Willem van de Meent](https://jwvdm.github.io/). I started my PhD at Northeastern University where I was for 4 years before transferring to University of Amsterdam. I got my MSc in Data Science at the University of Edinburgh. I did my BSc in Artificial Intelligence and Computer Science at the same University.

I am interested in deep generative models and how we can guide them towards learning useful representations for downstream tasks. Recently, I also became very interested in making generative models more space efficient via quantization. I am also a big fan of the intersection of information theory and representation learning.
