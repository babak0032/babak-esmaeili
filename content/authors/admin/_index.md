I am a fourth year PhD student in the Machine Learning program at Northeastern University, advised by Professor Jan-Willem van de Meent. I got my BSc in Artificial Intelligence and Computer Science at the University of Edinburgh. After that, I did an MSc in Data Science at the same University.

I am interested in deep generative models and how we can guide them towards learning better representations. For similar reasons, I am also interested in representation leaning, particularly the approaches that are inspired by information theory. I am also a fan of probabilistic programming which provides exciting opportunities for abstracting probabilistic models, as well as improving efficiency in inference.
